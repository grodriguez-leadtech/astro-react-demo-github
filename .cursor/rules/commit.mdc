When generating commit messages, strictly follow these 6 steps required by the Conventional Commits extension:

### Step 1: Type of change
- If no type is specified, always default to `feat`.
- If the user provides a specific type (fix, docs, chore, etc.), use that.

### Step 2: Scope
- Always skip the scope. Do not write "None" or anything else.

### Step 3: Emoji
- Select the most appropriate emoji for the change from the table below.
- Always include the emoji immediately after the type.

### Step 4: Short description
- Always use the **current branch name** as the short description.
- Do not modify, rephrase, or shorten it.
- Keep it exactly as it appears in Git.

### Step 5: Long description
- Provide a clear description of what was done in this commit.
- Use plain English (or the project’s default language).
- Summarize the key changes in 2–3 sentences max.

### Step 6: Footer
- Leave this completely blank and continue.
- Do not insert anything here.
